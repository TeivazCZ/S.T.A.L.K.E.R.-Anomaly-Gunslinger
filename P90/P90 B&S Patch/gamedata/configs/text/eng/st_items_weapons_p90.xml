		<text>The FN P90 submachine gun was developed in the late 1980s as a personal defence weapon for troops whose primary activities does not include small arms, such as vehicle and tank crew members, artillery crews etc. Standard pistols and submachine guns were proven ineffective against enemies wearing body armour. FN designers developed a new round, initially designated as SS90, to achieve high penetration while keeping recoil low FN used a small-bore approach, creating a round that looked like the scaled down 5.56 NATO round. The result was FN P90 personal defence weapon, introduced in 1990 along with improved 5.7x28 SS190 ammunition which replaced polymer cored bullets with heavier dual core, steel and aluminium, bullets for better penetration against body armour.\n \n
